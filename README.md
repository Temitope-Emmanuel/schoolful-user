# Welcome to Schoolful-user

This is a project (user part) that comes with awesome functionality, built with react and using chakra-ui with material-ui (a bit overkill), there is also a livestreaming service althought you'll have to setup an RTMP server. You can reach out to me if you need any extra help, the codebase is about 2 years old so something might need minor changes but it should still be good to go. Happy hacking :)
